# weekly_flutter_challenge_3_principle_fake_3d

## What I have learned during this challenge:
1. Blurring images by putting [BackdropFilter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYRs7Q1vfYI) widget above it in a stack.
2. Using PageView widget:
* changing [scrollDirection](https://medium.com/flutter-community/a-deep-dive-into-pageview-in-flutter-with-custom-transitions-581d9ea6dded)
* manually strolling to a given page
3. Using [GestureDetector](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/gestures/handling-taps) to make a Widget tappable.
4. Using [ChangeNotifierProvider](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple#changenotifierprovider) from [Privider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package. ALong with creating custom ChangeNotifier.
